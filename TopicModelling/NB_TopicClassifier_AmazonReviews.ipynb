Mr. de Becker is a prime example. A reader living outside the US might find de Becker's assumptions annoying if not outright ludicrous.<p>This book may also not sit well with relatives of violent criminals. It is de Becker's belief that poor parenting is at the root of most violent crime. Few would disagree that poor parenting can cause a child to grow up antisocial or criminal, but so can many other things; heredity, war, abuse by someone in trust other than a parent, the death of a parent, divorce, or poverty.\"},\n",

He does a great service in explaining techniques used by antisocials and ways to counteract them by following our instincts.\\t\\tOn the down side, the book contains a lot of anti-gun propaganda.  The author tends to make unsubstantiated claims about how having a gun makes one less safe.  He uses a couple of examples while ignoring the hundreds of cases annually where individuals with weapons have saved their own lives or those of others.\\t\\tAdditionally, he tends to do a lot of self promotion for his company and name dropping of the ultra leftist elites of Hollywood.  Although it may impress some readers that he has connections with Rosie O'Donnell and Barbara Streisand, it certainly does nothing to enhance his credibility.  On the contrary, it makes him appear to be a liberal with an agenda.  In this case, that is making people less self reliant for their own protection while promoting his company.  That is unfortunate as it takes away from the rest of the book that is so good.\\t\\tIn spite of the propaganda and self promotion, I would encourage people to read this book.

       " {'biologicalsciences_2010': \"Gavin De Becker's book, The Gift of Fear, is such a well written, informative book that it is a shame Mr. De Becker feels he must pander to women in order to sell his book. The opening note of the book is telling of things to come. He states that &quot;when it comes to violence, women can proudly relinquish recognition in the language, because here at least, politically correct would be statistically incorrect.&quot; This statement seems a bit absurd coming from someone whose own mother shot his stepfather. De Becker might want to look at his own use of attempting to be politically correct rather than statistically correct. He certainly chooses to ignore statistics involving the homicide rates in Florida since the concealed carry laws were passed. De Becker states he met a middle-aged couple from Florida who had decided to carry a weapon for protection around the city such as at restaurants, etc. De Becker, in his anti-gun mode (which appears to be his consensus throughout the book) says it would make more sense to carry sharp tubes to give emergency tracheotomies to people who are choking. Yet, he ignores that since the inception of the concealed carry laws, homicide rates in Florida have actually dropped. Carrying his logic through to other instances, one could also say that more children die in swimming pool accidents or from overdosing on iron pills than die from guns, but I certainly don't see the government outlawing vitamins and swimming pools. Really, Mr. De Becker, with all the wonderful insight and advice you give on changing how criminals are viewed in the media, I am surprised that you would fall victim to the same narrow-minded view with regard to gun ownership. You give advice on how to size up someone who might harm you, but you seem to advocate doing nothing or in the case of battered women--going into hiding at a women's shelter. The book seems to suggest that the honorable thing to do is to render oneself defenseless, especially if you are a woman. Yes, it would be nice if there were no guns in America but that would only leave the strong to prey on the weak. Of course, the weak could turn to someone with a gun to help, perhaps the police. And Oops! I forgot, thats what we need your firm for.  Helen Smith\\tKnoxville, Tennessee\"},\n",
       " {'biologicalsciences_2010': \"I read this book about 12 years ago and don't have a copy in my possession, so I can only write from what I remember. I had an instructor at a university who told us about this book. Approximately a year later, I ran into her on the street and asked her the name of the book. I then borrowed a library copy. DeBecker is a security expert for many celebrities and writes quite a bit about his protection consulting service. What is obvious in our country is that persons with severe mental illness get obsessed about persons who appear in the news or entertainment outlets. They stalk them and at times inflict violence upon them (John Lennon, Ronald Reagan, Rebecca Shaefer to name just a few). This book should make those Americans who want 15 minutes of fame question whether the price is worth it.The best anecdote in the book however, was when DeBecker was talking to some prisoners in a jail about his own upbringing. DeBecker grew up in a very violent household, and as I recall he and his siblings witnessed their mother stab their father or some such. One of the prisoners raised his hand and said to DeBecker \\\\I don't get it - I grew up in a household just like yours\"},\n",

I also own the RSPB guide to British birds which I picked up on the fly in the UK; however, I chose to leave that behind in favor of Mullarney et al. when I relocated to Germany. The descriptions, field marks, and pictures are wonderful. It also has pictures and descriptions of both males, females and juveniles, which my other book didn't have for all species, much to my dismay (at least 1 instance for a sexually dimorphic species). It's also relatively compact making it easier to carry in the field. The ordering of the songbirds is a little different from Sibley, but this is easy to adjust to. This certainly is a must have for all birders that might be traveling to Europe.\"},\n",

He discusses why people perform violent acts, and how his agency works  with the authorities to  prevent violent acts.<p>This book is troubling because it immerses the  reader in fear.  Mr. de Becker discusses the types of potentially violent  cases that his agency receives.  The author does list advance signals  indicating when individuals *might* fear for their safety, an extremely  useful discussion.  But  many of his examples concern public figures who  purposefully maintain high media visibility  (e.g., celebrities and  government officials).  Often these examples do not reflect threats faced  by private citizens.'},\n",

Each bird has a comprehensive description with details on identification and distinguishing it from other birds with a similar appearance or bird call. Each also has an illustration with the birds in multiple poses, M/F, adult/young, and other features such as common surroundings which was very helpful. There's no quick-key by color - birds are arranged by groups rather than color - but I found this to be a minor inconvenience weighed against the wealth of info in this book.\"},\n",

He goes through a great many common situations in which violence happens in the U.S., from encounters with strangers, workplace violence to domestic violence and date stalking. In each situation, he describes the indicators of likely violence. Some of these indicators are so often overlooked and rationalized away by the people involved.

It teaches us to trust our fear and not ignore it. As women and girls, we are too often taught to be polite, to not make waves, or to give someone the benefit of the doubt.As a result,we end up ignoring our instincts in an attempt not to appear rude or paranoid. Physical danger or a crime committed against us is the all-to-often result.This book teaches that there is a right and a wrong time for politeness, and that it is never wrong to follow your instincts.

At the time I was a patrol officer and I asked what reading the instructors would recommend.  The single book all the instructors recommended for everyone in the room regardless of rank and assignment was this book.\\tI purchased the book the next day and read it very quickly and found the information on these pages were easy to read, understand, and apply in my day to day work.  On numerous calls I found that lines from this book stood out to me and it provided me the advice I needed to give to people in various situations.  I gave my copy away for another officer to read and now I have found that my five copies I have purchased to keep for my own reference are all loaned out so I am happy to have the Kindle edition, at least I always have one copy with me now.\\tIn my current position as a violent crimes detective and combatives instructor I am often asked to give personal safety speeches.  The information in this book is invaluable to people of all ages, all neighborhoods and all groups.  Now the first and last slide of my presentations are to purchase this book or take the free one I give out to each class.  I have to say my instructors were exactly correct when they recommended this book to me; I've recommended this book countless times and will continue to do so.\"},\n",

I avoid newspapers and TV  news--it only darkens our view of the world. It only makes crime seem  worse. Give up news for two weeks and notice how your outlook  improves.<p>As a teacher of women's self-defense, I've heard many stories  of intuition. Some people call it the &quot;back ground music,&quot;  because it is like the music that plays in a movie before something bad  happens. <p>As deBecker writes, act upon your survival signals (run, search  your house in the middle of the night, stay away from an individual, etc.),  even if you feel foolish doing so.<p>Shed the fears in your life, because  fear clouds the survival signals. Those who live in fear of crime are  already victims.<p>Some of the book is difficult to read, such as chapters  on child abuse. But the book is still worth it. Buy copies for yourself and  friends. If you spend time worrying about crime, this book could change  your life.\"},\n",

It was interesting and I wanted to know more.  In listening to him and now the CDs, I recognize that there are times I know, just know that I should avoid something but because I don't want to make someone else feel bad, I will go with it anyway.  I bought the tapes because I wanted to hear them in detail and I wanted to give myself permission to love and care enough about myself to keep myself safe.  I also want to develop my inner sense and not be so busy that I don't pay attention.  If I am in error about the other person or event then I can apologize later.  Keeping yourself and your family safe is the most important key.  I am glad I bought it and would highly recommend The Gift of Fear, it made sense.\"},\n",

I sampled it on my Kindle  and then bought it. I enjoyed the whole lesson. Gavin de Becker was born into a dangerous home. He grew up witnessing horrible crimes. To protect himself and his little sister, Gavin learned to differentiate between fear and intuition. He learned not to live afraid, but instead to let his intuition guide him when he needed to act. He grew up to become an expert in threat assessment and his firm consults with everyone from the Secret Service to celebrities to average citizens all over the world. This was a real page turner, in simple to understand terms. Some of his case studies were so engrossing I had to stop and remind myself I was reading nonfiction, not a fictional thriller. I loved the book and hope that I come away with my intuition fine tuned and my nonproductive worry and fear cast aside. I recommend this book to everyone.'},\n",

All the  child molesters, male or female, I have had the unpleasant task of  interviewing are very &quot;charming&quot; and described by friends,  neighbors and acquaintances as a &quot;nice&quot; person.\"},\n",

He then goes on to say that, rather than surpressing our instinctive awareness of danger, we should heed its call, and do what we can to avoid risk to ourselves.  There are definite signs of what we should fear and what is not necessary to fear.  There are also positive steps that can be taken to avoid putting ourselves into a potentially dangerous situation. He teaches what an individual can do to, not only become aware of potential danger, but often to avoid it.  He then follows up with specific information pertinent to workplace violence, domestic violence, date stalking, violent children, and attacks against public figures.  His clear-headed advice could be potentially life-saving.  Here's a book well worth the read as its price could possibly be that of someone's life.\"},\n",

DeBecker writes with apparent authority on the subject and the books use of several case studies truly help the reader understand what type of mind one is dealing with in a self-defense situation against these sick minded whack jobs. I recommend the book to all my students of self-defense, regardless of their gender or age. Further, I suggest that my martial art and police students read it. The book serves as a great foundation of knowledge for those sincerely interested in self-defense and self-reliance. The pre-attack indicators are an excellent tool for avoiding and attempting to prevent personal danger. This book along with some good physical techniques of self-defense should be mandatory for all teenage girls prior to leaving home for college or work.

       " {'biologicalsciences_2010': \"In a well organized and presented book, de Gavin discusses the fact that an individual often experiences the intuition of something wrong before the onslaught of a violent act. He then goes on to say that, rather than surpressing our instinctive awareness of danger, we should heed its call, and do what we can to avoid risk to ourselves.  There are definite signs of what we should fear and what is not necessary to fear.  There are also positive steps that can be taken to avoid putting ourselves into a potentially dangerous situation. He teaches what an individual can do to, not only become aware of potential danger, but often to avoid it.  He then follows up with specific information pertinent to workplace violence, domestic violence, date stalking, violent children, and attacks against public figures.  His clear-headed advice could be potentially life-saving.  Here's a book well worth the read as its price could possibly be that of someone's life.\"},\n",

       " {'biologicalsciences_2010': \"This is a great book and I recommend it to all my friends, but I do like to give them a little information first.\\t\\tFirst of all, the author is a security specialist for rich and famous people, so he spends his days listening to threats and analyzing threatening situations.  All the info in the book comes from experiences of clients he's worked with.  He designed the MOSAIC Threat Assessment Systems used to screen threats to Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, members of United States Congress, and senior officials of the Central Intelligence Agency.  The guy certainly knows what he's talking about.\\t\\tSecond, you don't know me at all.  And I know my sister was never as paranoid as me so when she said the book isn't scary, I did not think that would apply to me.  I don't know if that makes sense.  Basically a lot of people don't have problems with things (i.e. CSI) that make it difficult for me to function in the dark :).  So embarrassing as it is, I want you to know that I don't shower when no one else is home, that I get nervous when there is an unexpected knock at the door (yes even in the day), and I usually run up the stairs at night even though I've just been down there and know no one is hiding in the dark.  BUT I used to be that and worse.\\t\\tThird, when I say that the book is not scary, it does come with a caveat.  The first story of the whole book is indeed scary.  (To make it short, girl lets someone come into her apartment, he rapes her, then says he is leaving but she knows he is going to kill her and she wraps the sheet around her and walks right past him in the kitchen out the door and into her neighbors house.)  But then he picks apart the situation to show how she could have avoided being a victim, and also discusses the difference between paranoia (like I was, looking for people behind parked cars and such) and real fear that drives action (like her walking right past the bad guy out of the apartment when he could have turned around and seen her there at any minute).  The rest of the examples in the book really didn't scare me, and even that one in the end helped me have confidence that if I get in a bad situation I may be able to survive.\\t\\tFourth, this book is full of information that really makes you think.  And while it isn't scary, I postponed reading it so long that I had to read it in two days to get it back to my sister in time.  And that was a little overwhelming.  I would recommend reading a chapter at a time and then waiting a day or so to have time to absorb and reflect.  Although I have a friend who just couldn't put it down even though I told her that, and she didn't mind reading it all in three sittings.\\t\\tAnyway just info I think is helpful.  I really do think all women should read this book.  And I'm not over-exaggerating when I say I think it has changed my life.  I am way less stressed, anxious and paranoid.  Not that I'm not careful.  I'm just not scared now of things that I don't need to be.\"},\n",

It also does a good job of stressing overall awareness of your surroundings.  Having said that, I think there were a few instances where he inappropiately places intuition over logic.  For example, I cannot remember what page it was, but he stated that a woman had a violent boyfriend who threatened to kill her, beat her, etc., and then goes on to say that the woman's intuition should have told her something was wrong.  If someone threatens such things, it's not intuition to think something is wrong, it is perfectly reasonable.  That, and it seemed he tried to inject too many anti-gun arguments, when the book was about how to deal with violent people, not how they acquirerd the means to be violent.  Still, it's a good book, but I think I would have given it three and a half stars if I could have.\"},\n",

On the other hand, at times I found the author's writing style to be paternalistic and self-aggrandizing. He seems deeply impressed with himself and his accomplishments. The book is also repetitive in places, although I believe that may be intentional, to drive home his points about safety and trusting your instincts. However, the chapter on how men and women differ in their perceptions of danger was worth the cost of the book - it gave me a way to explain to my husband why women are fearful in situations where men would not be. His comment that, at the core, men are afraid women will laugh at them, and women are afraid men will kill them, was profound. So do I recommend this book?

       " {'biologicalsciences_2010': \"THE GIFT OF FEAR: AND OTHER SURVIVAL SIGNALS THAT PROTECT US FROM VIOLENCE by Gavin de Becker is a helpful, engaging quick read (it's a trade paperback of around 380 pages). His premise is that fear is a means of survival and that if we listen to it and follow it, we can save our own and others' lives; however, for various reasons, we often discount our intuition about danger or we don't listen to our fear and put ourselves unnecessarily at risk.<p>The book begins with a &quot;true crime&quot; story about Kelly, a woman who was raped in her apartment by a man she met in her stairwell who offered to carry the groceries she had dropped up to her apartment. De Becker parses the incident and categorizes the methods the attacker employed to get her to do what he wanted and put herself under his control, and this section is very enlightening. But the main theme of this first chapter and the book is that men and women should follow their intuition -- intuition isn't some flighty, sixth sense; it's a call to action when your brain has become aware of many small signs that something isn't right, even if, at that moment, you cannot articulate exactly what is wrong.<p>This book is not a self-defense or how-to guide, but rather makes a case for intuition and believing in oneself when one senses danger or feels fear, and the best reading in it, I think, is the examples de Becker explicates from his many years in the security and risk-assessment business (he also lived through an exceedingly violent and abusive childhood). The chapters address being in the presence of danger, how intuition works and functions, the science of violence predictors, survival signals, violent crime from strangers, high-stakes predictions, understanding threats to kill, dealing with too-persistent people, violence in the workplace, domestic violence, dating abuses and violence, violent children, public figure attacks and pursuits and extreme cases.<p>I found several things particularly interesting and engaging about this book. First, de Becker states emphatically throughout the work that violence is predictable, and that no one ever &quot;just snaps&quot; or is just an inexplicably bad person. Second, his predictor of violence is a useful tool -- and I would think may be applicable in other assessment situations -- to make informed judgments on risk. Third, I got a great deal personally out of his comparisons of worry and anxiety with fear in which he suggest that the first two are destructive and distracting (and may prevent someone from spotting real danger signs), but that fear is what has saved many, many lives and could save your own. Fourth, his writing on people who are too persistent is very interesting, and he shows how people's attempts to deal with stalkers is often just going to keep the situation alive.<p>Finally, the chapter on domestic violence was absolutely fascinating, primarily because this is a man who deals in truth and reality, not romance and excuses. He states that when assessing relationships, women often make judgments based on potential rather than on the present situation, which causes them to ignore warning signs and predictive incidents. He also says that he is in the business of safety, not justice, and that because of that he isn't a supporter of restraining orders in all cases because in some, they aggravate the offender more and can actually be a precipitating incident toward murder or its attempt.<p>Toward the beginning of the book, de Becker writes about how men don't really understand the risk under which women constantly live, but that for women personal safety is a constant consideration. He writes, &quot;Men are worried that women will laugh at them. Women are worried that men will kill them.&quot; I learned a lot about listening to intuition, choosing not to worry and living safely.<p>I recommend this book, especially to women.\"},\n",

It spends a little too long focusing on the criminal mind instead of the average one, contrary to what the first few sections would have you believe. While this material on stalkers, mass murderers, and assassins is fascinating, it seemed to be more of a diversion from the central idea than a support for it. Still, De Becker is terribly knowledgable on how a desperate human mind works (for both attacker and attacked) and does a good job of relating it to the reader using stories, examples, and plain speech. The occassional tangent (on local news, for example) is forgivable, because of the importance of his message. We all have what it takes to take care of ourselves, if we only learn how to listen to ourselves.'},\n",

In my long experience as a practicing martial artist, I have never come across a book, that is so valuable in that it can facilitate the avoidance of danger.  This book will make you feel better.  It is at times scary, but ultimately the reader feels empowered, because with the added information, one can see more options.  I have already given a couple of copies to friends, who have called back with enthusiasm, after they have read it.  The book may be lacking in a couple of areas, but that isn't a loss.  Those areas will be adressed by other books that &quot;The Gift of Fear&quot; will inspire.

The useful infomation is short (such as one page in a chapter).  What makes up much of the book is theory and the author's personal cases.  <p>What is lacking are illustrations of the practical information.  Such would be very helpful, but such illustrations are few, replaced with examples to illustrate theory.  These theories lend themselves to interjections of liberal points of view.<p>Here is an example.  &quot;I think we should talk about what to do if you are faced with a man pointing a gun at you.  What should you do?  Well, let me tell you the story of a case I was on involving a class that contained a student with a gun....  The point of this example was to show that these people did not have the tools to handle the situation.  Now, if they had read this book they would have been prepared.  You are reading this book and so you are prepared.  This proves that we need gun control laws.  Back to our situation.  What should you do if you are faced with a man pointing a gun at you?  We will deal with that in a later chapter.  Until that time, let me give you another example of a case I worked on.&quot;<p>You get the point.

I know a number of people that have been involved in similar situations that were described in the book. Few chose the path of common sense. This always mystified me until I read the book. I can at least now understand why that happens. I would hope that if nothing else the book will re-awaken common sense in people when faced with a dangerous situation.\\t\\tSecond, the one reviewer that didn't read the book was most amusing.

Moreover,in an emergency situation I choose the person that I want to help me, as opposed to receiving help from someone offering assistance. De Becker says that we would be more likely to pick a &quot;safe&quot; individual from a crowd than receiving help from someone who just appears out of nowhere. I have used De Becker's book in my work with  battered women and firmly believe that his work should be required in all self-defense classes, mainly because he teaches that our brain is the most powerful weapon against crime.

This book did more than just  inform me; it provided me with the key knowledge that my instincts to  survive have been what's saved me.  I'd always thought I had escaped danger  because of quirks  of fate, but deBecker shows that we escape danger when  we listen to our own inner voices.  deBecker shows us all how to listen to  our own intuition......and gives fantastic survival examples in the  process. I'd highly recommend this book, particularly because deBecker  gives hard, concrete examples from which we can truly learn, rather than  esoteric discussions which leave us wondering, &quot;How do I do it?&quot;  deBecker gives us this information in black-and-white, and in examples that  are easily understood and easily followed. I don't, however, mean to make  this book sound simplistic. DeBecker's writing style is excellent. In  many  ways, this book reads like a true crime survival novel....but, in fact, the  survival we're reading and learning about is our own.\"},\n",

This book  teaches how to listen to your intuition, and why you should NEVER ignore  it.  I CAN HONESTLY TELL YOU THAT EVERY WORD OF THIS BOOK IS TRUE.  Women  often find themselves in &quot;uncomfortable situations,&quot; but rarely  listen to that little voice that is telling them to get the hell out of  there... and when you choose to ignore it, you are putting your life on the  line.  If you choose not to read this book, just remember this... never  ignore or try to rationalize with your intuition- it is usually right.  Don't worry about Hurting someones feelings or being rude, if you have a  funny feeling about someone, get out of there right away!  You have nothing  more to lose than your life.\"},\n",

I can't count how many times I've done it: The guy at a party who says, &quot;Come over here -- there's a guy who says he knows you.&quot; The man who approaches you on the street and says, &quot;Hey, baby, you have a boyfriend?&quot;<p>De Becker also urges us to listen to our inner voice -- the one that says &quot;something here is wrong.&quot; Too often, we tell ourselves, &quot;I'm sure he's a perfectly nice man. There's nothing to worry about.&quot;<p>Also important is the chapter on how potential rapists/murders approach victims. The author explains how an attacker tries to get a victim to feel comfortable with him and thus make herself vulnerable.<p>Of course, there are also plenty of practical safety tips in here.

Since then I've recommended it to friends and acquaintences - a few in direct danger of stalking exes, most worrying about the escalation of violence in our culture.<p>I thank Gavin DeBecker for writing this book.  His penchant for  awakening intelligent intuition is remarkable.  Have you ever put yourself  in a potentially dangerous situation because you didn't want to appear  rude? (given too much information to a stranger?  gotten on an elevator  with someone even though you felt uncomfortable)?  Has anyone ever thrown  you off balance and then taken advantage of your weakness?  DeBecker shows  how fear sends us trouble calls, and how often, and easily, we ignore the  signals. (An added plus, these techniques even work against the tactics of  car salespeople!).  <p>THE GIFT OF FEAR teaches the reader to listen to  intuition and act with confidence.  If we can perceive violence on the  horizon, we can most easily avoid a confrontation with it.  If it takes us  by surprise, we can address it without panic.  Now, go read the excerpt.\"},\n",

I'm probably one of the youngest readers of The Gift of Fear, but Gavin de Becker's words empowered me just as much as they did the next person.  I loved the book.  It made me realize that I have to stop ignoring my body, my intuition.  If you haven't read this book, go out and get it!  It will teach you so many things.  Ever since a couple of years ago, I knew I wanted to help people.  I'm the person my friends come to when they have a conflict, I like giving advice and solving people's dilemmas.  There was one problem: I didn't heed my own advice.  I didn't listen to myself many times because I could picture people saying, &quot;Oh, that's a silly suspicion.&quot;  Fortunately, I have never been in a situation in which I deeply regret ignoring my intuition, but after reading The Gift of Fear I have learned how to listen to myself.  I also babysit.  The other day I was holding one of the children, and he pointed to one of my brother's friends and whispered to me, &quot;I'm scared of him.&quot;  I thought for a moment and replied, &quot;Well, you know what?  That's OK.&quot;  I told him that if he's ever afraid, he should leave where that person is and go find Mommy, or me, or someone he knows and doesn't feel afraid.  I was proud that he listened to his intuition, but I think I was more proud of my response.  I was totally psyched that I had reinforced something he needs to survive.  My point is that The Gift of Fear taught me how to use my gift of intuition and my gift of fear.  Read the book because you will learn from it; you will use the tactics everyday.  Best of all, you will become more comfortable with every day life and you will use the wonderful treasures mother nature has given you because it was instilled in you by Gavin de Becker.

That *should* be counter-intuitive, right?  One is loud, the other is quiet?

Message? Run & hide or better-hire his services. My recommendation for any person being stalked,threatened,or harassed? Get a concealed carry firearm permit (the majority of states have them,now),get a handgun you can handle proficiently,get instruction at a good firearms training school such as Lethal Force Institute,Gunsite,etc,and get back to living your life.

Some man that victimized women started THAT rule in our culture.  This is a GREAT book with very real insight into how to listen to your automated response cycles - your body senses things long before you \\\\\"think\\\\\" about them and we may be technologically advanced but listing to that gut feeling is important because as people often point out; it is never wrong!<p>Most victims of violent crime will tell you when looking back that if they had not been engaging in politeness or rationalization that there were warning signs of the impending violence that they ignored.  In no way does this mean that victims are responsible for what happens to them.  Instead this is a good guide to returning to lisening to our instincts.  Humans are the only animal that participate in our own victimization.  DeBecker says it himself in \\\\\"Protecting the Gift\\\\\"  ( A MUST READ FOR PARENTS ) that a gazelle will run when there is a lion - not try to tell herself that maybe THIS lion is a NICE lion.  Humans are the only animals that sense a predator and then try to talk themselves into believing they should be nice to someone that gives them the creeps.<p>READ this book and don\\'t listen to it - let this book teach you about how to listen to your body\\'s signals about danger and safety.\"'},\n",

De Becker is a (now) famous author specialising in protection; he speaks very authoritatively about it and from reading this and some of his other books, I can understand why: he certainly has the pedigree and experience to do so. The tactics he proffers are simple and quick to implement. It requires nothing more fantastic than common sense (which as we all know, isn't common!). Altogether, this is a great book.

Also, there a many times De Becker mentions \\\\....& I'll covering such & such in more detail in chapter so & so).

You learn how to let go of needless worries and  anxieties and instead listen to your natural insticts, which can truly  protect you from harm.  The book is a great tool for both men and women,  but women especially can identify with the stories and content.  Ever had a  stalker, or even just an ex-boyfriend who won't go away?  You can learn  what you're unintentionally doing to still encourage him, girls, and learn  how to rid your life of these sort of harmful people for once and for all.  All the stories and info are true, but written like a thriller...the  celebrity protection tales are utterly riveting.  Once you're done with  this book, you will know everything from how to screen-out potentially  unbalanced employees to how to walk to your car in a deserted garage at  night.

What I am sensing is that something is not quite right or that the setup, the circumstances, are putting me into a position that I have to trust the individual more than I would like.  I think that this is a nice person. I think that my electrical surge feeling is just unfortunate garbage from my past.  Every time I discount it, I get into trouble and I loose something.  The Gift of Fear is correct.  Trust your intuitions. People who have been hurt in the past have a better set of intuitions.  People who have not been hurt feel silly to trust the intuition.  Intuition and common sense are God given.  Say thank you and use these gifts.  In a sense I like this book but on the other hand I feel it is creating fear.

It just so happens I finished reading this book yesterday as well. It was given to me by a considerate male friend who'd read it, bought several copies, and was lending them to as many friends (esp. females) as he could get interested. <p>The real value of _The Gift of Fear_ lies in its practical approach to informing our intuitive sense of *real* fear, while separating it from our more common practice of needless worry (which in effect clouds our perceptive powers, leaving us more vulnerable).<p>Don't be turned off by the sensationalized cover statement, &quot;This book can save your life!&quot; It's not false hype. In addition to the obvious benefit to women, the book also provides men some rare insight into how the women they love approach their everyday lives. It also informs both genders of important ways to safeguard their children. I'll be giving copies of _The Gift of Fear_ away this Christmas.\"},\n",

A female officer recommended this book to me, and said it has very good advice and to internalize it.\\t\\tShe was so right!  I read it twice, I read passages out loud, and I followed the advice.

       " {'biologicalsciences_2010': \"This book emerged onto a highly competitive market already burgeoning with numerous field guides covering the region, most by renowned authors and many having benefitted from improvement over several editions. Quite simply though, this book won instant recognition as the best field guide available for Europe - and perhaps a model for field guides everywhere. Its authors are well known experts in their field having spent many years studying and publishing on the birds of the region. However, the key to the guide's success is the fact that so much more useful information has been condensed into a guide which is much the same size as existing books. The book boasts excellent illustrations, succinct text and handy maps, all presented on a the same page. Small enough to fit into a pocket (about the same size as the National Geographic guide) and cheap, it is a must for anyone visiting Europe. As one reviewer has already pointed out, it is indispensable in Alaska too - not just for Palaearctic vagrants, but for regular shorebirds and some residents. Don't hesitate!\"},\n",

I believe that this book gave me incredible insight about myself, as well as other people, including the noncriminal.  I am really glad that I had the opportunity to read this book because I have an anger problem and it helped me to realize how to not become abusive and what signs to look for in others, as well as myself, for potential abuse.  I feel that Gavin DeBecker did a wonderful job in putting a personal touch, rather than a mechanic, unfeeling theme to the book, and this is what made me love, cherish, and relate to the book so incredibly well.  Thank you Gavin.\"},\n",

There have been many hunters reporting about male tigers killing and eating cubs. Valmik Thapar's observations in Ranthambhore tell the opposite. In a more or less stable natural environment, without the constant persecution by hunters and poachers, male tigers meet their family occasionally for eating, resting, and sometimes even for playing.\\t\\tFrom 1986 to 1988 Fateh Singh and Valmik Thapar could observe three tiger families, mother father and cubs, resting, eating and playing together. Some of the cubs could survive into sub-adulthood within two years, but even then, there were no signs of any conflict with the resident father.\\t\\tI enjoyed reading this book from the beginning to the end, and finished it within a single day.

It was completely hands on, and it addressed the topic from the perspective of a biologist, not a technophile-- which was exactly what I needed. It helped me reconcile my love for pure science with my increasing anxiety about needing to be so darn computer proficient to have any kind of job I can apply my degree to these days.

All are important, but anxiety and worry are destructive.  This book tells how to unshackle yourself from these destructive behaviors, and how to harness the constructive gifts of fear, perception, and instinct.\\t\\tAs a woman who has taken a whole lot of self defense classes (both psychololgically and physically based), I can tell you one thing they all share with this book:  Don\\'t act like a victim.  If you act cowed- walking with head down, hood up, and keys out- you look like a good target.  Predators attack those that appear weak.  This book explains how regain confidence by listening to yourself, which in turn becomes a doubly protective mechanism.\\t\\tIn closing, I read through the one star reviews, and they all seem to have an axe to grind because DeBecker doesn\\'t advocate owning a gun as a means of protection.  While I don\\'t think this makes the author anti-gun, I do think it\\'s important for people like me, who are NOT comfortable owning a gun, to have resources other than, \\\\buy a handgun and learn to shoot it\\\\\".

Phylogenetic systematics or Cladistics is a young field relative to the more than 200 years of taxonomic history. The  pioneers textbooks on the subject (e.g., Nelson and Platnick, Wiley),  although excellent, appeared at the beginning of the eighties and reflect  the turbulent history of systematics during the late sixties and most of  the seventies. The rapid maturation of the field during the next decade  rendered these books quickly out of date regarding methods of analysis (the  conceptual framework is still as fresh as ever). Other edited textbooks in  English appeared at the beginning of the nineties, but their lack of  condensation and consistency and their often lack of critical evaluation  made them even dangerous for students trying to learn the subject. R. T.  Schuh book comes to the rescue of students trying to become good  systematists. The book summarizes and condenses the various topics of  Cladistics without loosing important details. It also stresses the place of  phylogenetic studies inside general biological taxonomic practices,  debunking the myth that you must either construct phylogenies or work on  taxonomy and nomenclature. Every student of biology must read this book.'},\n",

DeBecker paints a grim picture of violence in America, but also states that the media is largely responsible for our anxieties and fears.  We hear and see so much violence on television that we are almost desensitized.  Our basic instinct is eroding to the point where we can no longer distinguish the difference between real fear and worry.  He offers scenarious which illustrate the differences between these two emotions.<p>He also states that we have a better chance of hurting ourselves than someone else doing it for us.  How?  We ignore our basic instincts when someone approaches, whose behavior is questionable.  The Gift of Fear not only addresses the signals these people throw at us, but tells us how we should handle that person.<p>In his book, he fictionizes his cases to illustrate how women put themselves in a situation where they beaten, raped, stalked, and murdered.  At the end, he summarizes how they could have avoided their snag.  He points out that the police and judicial system offer little to help these women once they are in this situation.  I, myself, have heard about this scenario many times.<p>What got to me was a thirteen year-old boy, named Eric.  He and his mother had their luggage stolen while on vacation.  The hotel manager was very helpful and 'nice'.  He was so nice that he made a special trip across the country to see this boy.  In short, he was a sexual predator.  Fortunately for Eric, his mother was put off by this man.  Out of all the stories recounted in this book, this one gave me chills.  <p>Again, DeBecker lists the danger signs that we should watch out for and the common sense tactics of avoiding these criminals.  At the back of the book, is a list of agencies who help battered women and children cope and survive.  I would recommend this book for everyone.\"},\n",

Text and range maps are  opposite the plates and are quite detailed with further field marks,  habitat information, identification tips, and detailed discussion of voice.  The important characteristics are in italics which make them easier to find  in the very small print. The information is incredibly thourough,  especially for a book of this size. Attention is also paid to hybrids ducks  and identification skills for gulls and waders. The range maps are clear  with migration areas also marked. The guide is small enough for use in the  field, well organized, and easy to use.

I especially like how he didn't mince words, led clearly from the topic of one chapter to another, and repeated over and over in different ways the central concepts of his book.\\t\\tI do agree with previous reviewers' criticisms, such as his dubious statistics, his peculiarly nameless name-dropping (a famous film and recording star who was not only his client but a dear friend..?), and somewhat critical stance on guns.  But come on people.  Gavin de Becker is not going to take away your right to bear arms.\\t\\tBut the main premise of this book, listen to that intuitive fear signal and don't say, 'oh it's probably nothing,' is fantastic.  Also, why have I never seen the main elements of a con drawn out so clearly?  Forced teaming, too many details, charm, etc... this was very valuable to me, as was the opportunity to understand acts of violence from a point of view of prevention instead of the insane point of view that the news media takes.  Also I loved his criticism of the media, concrete evidence of how ridiculous most news stories are, and suggestion that we all take a break from the evening news.  I've been taking that break for about 10 years now.  Thanks Mr. De Becker!\"},\n",

       " {'biologicalsciences_2010': \"If you decide to read this book and support the private ownership of firearms just be aware that the author clearly does not.  Towards the end of the book he describes an incident where a burglar surprises a father who is sleeping. The burglar has the father's gun in his hand and ends up holding the father and his daughters for about an hour.  GdeB goes on to describe how the burglar ends up leaving the CD player he was going to steal, but took the gun with him. He also says the burglar did the father and his family a favor by taking the gun from them and getting it out of  the house.\\t\\tThroughout the book this theme rears its ugly head from time to time.  I would have enjoyed the book much better if GdeB had kept his anti gun rhetoric out of it.  There was nothing constructive added to the book by his rhetoric and he ignores the fact that privately owned firearms are used thousands of times a year to protect the owners and others from violence.\\t\\tHaving said that, I did gather some useful insight into the minds of the victims, stalkers and spousal abusers that I deal with on a daily basis.\"},\n",
       " {'biologicalsciences_2010': \"Overall, there is good information here. Primarily aimed at women, the book teaches people how to listen to their fear. Don't be afraid to be rude when suspicious individuals invade your space, and don't be afraid to trust your instincts when something's not right about a person.\\t\\tThe book falls short from the author's constant plugs for his own expertise and that of his company. Also, his anti-gun paranoia is just annoying. By the author's own statistics, three in four women will, at some point in their lives, be a victim of a violent crime. After our inner voice tells us we're in trouble, then what? He spends a good part of the book dropping names of famous friends and clients, from Oprah Winfrey to Bill Clinton, without mentioning that each of these people are defended day and night by guns. Take the good advice the book has to offer about reading dangerous people, and ignore the bad advice about self-defense. We all have a natural right to defend ourselves from violence.\"},\n",

Give the guy a break; don't judge people (or don't judge books by their covers); don't be an elitist, etc.  The author here simply points out that it doesn't matter what pure or neutral rationalizations you force through your brain, since you can still be raped, robbed or beaten, or worse, right in the middle of your upbeat thought.  His point here reminded me of the community activist on the West Side of Chicago who was killed with a pipe to the head by some punk who never knew that this woman had for over 20 years worked as a reconciliation advocate in her changing community--as he spied her walking along in a vulnerable position, and then demanded her purse.  His perspective on her was more decisive.  Should she have been more careful?  Or was she paying the price of unconditional love and acceptance toward her neighbors?  <p>This is a good message for, e.g., the high school girls who blithely suggest that they be dropped off at the store, to walk the mile home at 10:00 pm, not realizing how they will look to some criminal in that situation.  &quot;But I don't feel scared&quot; they will protest.  &quot;Hey, it doesn't matter how you feel.&quot;  <p>This book counsels that we listen to our adult intuition, and that we help our kids develop theirs.  It's a good argument for looking to things like PADS, or other organizations, to channel our concern for the poor and homeless, and to control their access to our daughters and property.  Nothing mean spirited or discriminatory about that, not when we calculate the millions of years of life that criminals deprive us of each year by their activity.\"},\n",

       " {'biologicalsciences_2010': 'A highly readable book that made many fictions look rather boring.  You won\\'t waste your money for a good weekend\\'s enjoyment even if you don\\'t follow through with the advice.  The gist of the book is not very complicated, though, to be of more practical use, one has to go beyond this book (which for corporations or high-net-worth folks mean buying the services of Gavin de Becker Incorporated). Gavin\\'s more important lessons can be summarized below:\\t\\t1. Make use of fear (intuition) to act rather than to worry (last chapter: The Gift of Fear), though easier said than done.\\t\\t2. Act promptly and quickly based on \\\\evidence\\\\\" provided by one\\'s instinct/intuition/unconscious (page 182: They told us'},\n",
       " {'biologicalsciences_2010': \"The book concentrates largely on threat assessment, de\\tBecker's specialty--reading behavoral cues to gauge how likely someone\\twill be to initiate violence.  It deals to a lesser extent with how to\\t handle people that your assessment tells you are going to be a\\t problem.  De Becker systematically goes through cases where violence\\t aparrently came &quot;out of the blue&quot; and demonstrates that in each\\t situation, there were plenty of danger signals, and that the victim's\\t intuition had already registered these signals and communicated them\\t as feelings of uneasiness.  People invariably knew that\\t something was out of place, but ignored the feelings.  The book goes\\t on to inform the reader's intuition with an analytical breakdown of\\t danger signals in different environments: from strangers, stalkers,\\t angry employees, controlling spouses, obsessive fans, and people who\\t deliver death threats.  The bottom line for de Becker is &quot;listen to\\t your gut-level intuition&quot;; people usually have a pretty acute sense\\t of when they are truly at risk.\\t\\t <p>The book's biggest shortcoming is that it deals only with the\\t above situations--where the potential aggressor is known to the\\t victim, or some kind of seduction is present before violence is\\t initiated.  On page 61 de Becker writes:\\t\\t <p>&quot;I haven't focused here on the criminal who simply walks\\t up, displays a weapon, and demands money.  That is because he is\\t distinctly more obvious that those who use the strategies I've\\t described&quot;\\t\\t <p>\\t And with that farewell he abandons fifty percent of the violent crimes\\t in America to concentrate on the ones where threat assessment might\\t make a more substantial difference in the outcome.  This can\\t unfortunately leave the reader with the impression that all crime is\\t avoidable, when in fact, the cases that don't fit his profiles\\t (interpersonal contact with victim precedes violence) haven't even\\t been discussed.  Conspicuously absent are:\\t\\t <p>\\t\\t 1. Any evaluation, pro or con, of firearms or other self-defense\\t precautions for personal protection, though indirectly he\\t recommends IMPACT associates, who provide self-defense training for\\t women.  This omission is unfortunate, because &quot;get a gun&quot; is\\t oft-quoted counsel for people at risk, and de Becker's perspective could make a difference.\\t\\t <p>\\t\\t 2. Any analysis of victim selection in predatory crime, or\\t suggestions for avoiding appearing &quot;victimizable.&quot;  The latter is a\\t particularly unfortunate omission, since the perceived vulnerability\\t of a victim is a significantly influential factor in whether or\\t not they will be selected for violence, and it is something that\\t people can take definite action about.<p>\\t\\t <p> The book is also remarkably short on suggestions about what to do\\t once you know someone means you ill.  In only three scenarios does de\\t Becker have a set of proactive recommendations: firing an angry\\t employee, leaving an abusive spouse, and cutting off communications\\t with persistent or obsessive callers.  His recommendations in these\\t cases are excellent, but in the rest of his examples (stalkings,\\t children known to be at sexual risk, violent assaults by\\t strangers, burglars in the house, credible death threats, persistent\\t violations of restraining orders, recreational assaults by teenagers)\\t he has very little to say beyond identifying risk factors.  As my wife\\t pointed out, his primary, and recurring, scenario (that of Kelly, who,\\t knowing that she was going to be killed if she followed a rapist's\\t instructions to stay put, instead silently followed him down the\\t hallway and let herself out the door) is a fantasy of non-violent\\t conflict resolution.  Far more common is the situation where the\\t threat is known, but options are uncertain.  De Becker investigates\\t the situations where neighbors say &quot;We had no idea; we would have\\t never suspected,&quot; but pays little attention to the countless\\t situations where the neighbors were expecting it all along, had known\\t for years that there was going to be trouble, and who it was going to come\\t from.\\t\\t <p> Because the fundamental conclusion of the book is correct: people\\t usually do have an accurate and powerful sense of their own\\t risk.  If you go for a ride with the LAPD, they know who the\\t drug dealers and gangbangers and chronic offenders are, and often have\\t a good idea of who their victims will be.  What to do about it--now,\\t there's a more difficult issue.\\t\\t <p>That said, I think this book is looking in the right direction:\\t victim empowerment.  It's not a book for law enforcement or\\t professional security agencies--it's a book written for the individual\\t at risk.  It emphasizes that you are the person who makes the\\t difference in your own security--especially in situations where the\\t probable aggressor is someone you know.  It encourages people not to\\t participate in their own victimization, and repeatedly shows that in\\t critical moments in the commission of crimes, you are the only person\\t who can make the difference.  His information on threat assessment is\\t excellent, written with the honest intention of giving the reader\\t enough intelligence to take to recognize risk when they see it and to\\t take proactive steps toward their own security. I highly recommend\\t this book to anyone with an interest.\\t\\t <p>Other recommended reading: John Douglas, _Mindhunter_, and\\t Robert Ressler _Whoever Fights Monsters_ (on the FBI's profiling of\\t serial criminals); Paxton Quigley, _Not an Easy Target: A Women's\\t Guide to Self-Protection_ (on victim selection and pragmatic threat\\t avoidance); Linden Gross, _To Have and to Harm: True Stories of\\t Stalkers and their Victims_.\"},\n",

The dangers that De Becker talks about are more likely to affect women and celebrities (i.e. stalking, rape), but he also talks about robberies, teen suicides/murders, intra-family crimes of violence, etc.  He repeatedly talks about how predictable crimes are based on people's past behavior, as well as the simple measures we can use to determine whether or not strangers likely mean us harm or have intentions other than those stated by them.  My main critique of the book is that it sometimes came off like a big advertisement for his firm, which specializes in security services and consulting rather than as a guide for everyone.

I was suspicious that the author could advocate fear as a useful tool, but he vindicates himself beautifully. He distinguishes fear from  worry and anxiety. True fear alerts you to danger and drives you to action,  while worry and anxiety simply drain your energy over trivial concerns.  Readers will actually feel less worry as they gain a more realistic  understanding of how manipulators work and how we can defuse and escape  their tactics. Readers will gain peace of mind knowing that violence is  predictable,and they do have the innate ability to perceive it and react  intelligently.

The good thing about having it on audio is that I will probably listen to it again (my kid's tantrums prevented me from paying attention the whole time).  He explains things in a very simple way so that you don't get lost in wording and can really grasp his message.  A lot of the things he mentions sounds like common sense but when you're in that situation it's easy to get off-track, next thing you know you aren't listening to yourself and you become a victim.

Towards the end, the book seemed to get bogged down with celebratity stalkings and what not, but I was able to extract the overall meaning.  I would suggest this book to any and every female.  Just don't let it make you paranoid.  After all the lists of what to look for in a dangerous man, the book should have had a list for what not to get too paranoid about.  I say that because at first glance, most of the lists could be applied to any man in a bar trying to get a females phone number.  Toward the end of the book, Gavin touched on that a little, but I think the distinction could have been stronger.<p>Overall, it's well worth the read.  The things you learn from this book will probably stay with you for life!\"},\n",

       " {'biologicalsciences_2010': \"When you're holding this little piece of excellent craftsmanship, detail and information it's not difficult to find out why it is considered one of the best field guides in the world.\\t\\tThis is the American version of the book (exact same content, different publisher. The original one is from Collins publishers) in its new, revised second edition. If you're looking for a field guide to the birds of Europe (and beyond!), look no more. This field guide is just...plain...AWESOME.\\t\\tNote: This field guide covers much more than just Europe and Iceland. It also covers all of Turkey, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, West Bank (Palestinian authority) and Jordan, plus the Sinai Peninsula (Egypt), and all of Northern Africa that is 30Âº North (extreme northernmost Morocco, northern Algeria, all of Tunisia, extreme northernmost Libya, and extreme northernmost Egypt north of Cairo or Nile delta). In addition, it covers all of Russia west of the Ural mountains (a little farther, actually--up to the mainstream of the Ob river east of the Ural mtns.,about 65Âº E). It also covers north Atlantic islands near Europe/North Africa, such as the Azores, Madeiras, Canaries and Selvages.\\t\\tNow to the review:\\t\\tFirst of all, the basic organization and layout of the book is clear and easy to use--no flipping through field guide plates to text to maps. The illustrations are on one side and the text directly on the other. However, unlike most field guides that use this layout, the text is much more lengthy and informative. The maps are found directly below the text.\\t\\tAs for the illustrations, they are like nothing I've ever seen before. They aren't extremely detailed, allowing the birds to look alive and realistic. In addition, practically every plumage is shown, including variations and subspecies. Arrows and text point out distinctive field marks, behavior and other important characteristics. But the most amazing thing is that 85% of the time they show you a drawing of the bird in the distance in its natural habitat, just the way you'd see it in the field.\\t\\tThe text is very informative. Field marks are described in italics in order for one to find them easily. It also provides the bird's population/range status (abundant, common, uncommon, rare, vagrant, etc.). Note: The type is somewhat small, but unless you have eye problems this shouldn't be a problem (if you do have eye problems, you may want to purchase the large format edition published by Collins, or use a magnifying glass).\\t\\tTowards the end of the book there are several lists of rarities or vagrants that have made their way to the area, even if they have been recorded only once.\\t\\tWhat could be improved on:\\t\\tOverall, this field guide is absolutely awesome and a must for every birder--even if you don't live in Europe. However, I believe the introduction could be a little lengthier and the maps and type a little bit larger. The other thing is that it would be useful if political country lines were shown, but the problem isn't that big (although it should be considered when making a third edition).\\tHowever, this DEFINITELY should NOT prevent you from getting this field guide.\"},\n",

Guess what? Your psychology and fear never trumps a gun or knife in your attacker's hands.\\t\\tThe most calm people are typically the ones who have had training in self-defense and quality firearm training. De Becker's own sometimes-partner - Dave Grossman - cites statistics (in On Combat) of how well-trained soldiers when they come home are LESS LIKELY than others in their age group to ever commit a violent act. Why? it's because they know that they can diffuse a situation if they have to and they have nothing to prove. They are more calm and they can quickly handle those who oppose them when needed far better than people who are untrained.\\t\\tDe Becker doesn't want YOU to have that skill. He doesn't want others to have the skills needed to handle whatever situation arises which results - especially in young males in their mid-teens through about 28 - a need to test others, to show themselves worthy, to test their own skills (lacking typically) against others, often those weaker than themselves of course such as women.\\t\\tI read every word of De Becker's book. Fortunately, I've been well-trained. I knew the moment I finished this dangerous book to remove it from the premises immediately on the chance that someone I know might get their hands on it and believe that fear and psychology is what they need to diffuse violence.\\t\\tSave your money.

It covers all the living species of native mammals from Mexico to Panama (including aquatic species such as whales and  otters). For each species there is a careful description of its physical  appearance along with notes on habitats, ranges (with maps) and behaviour,  as well as  other useful comments such as the best place to see a  particular species,  what the ground tracks look like and the status of  threatened species. It is an absolute mine of fascinating information, much  of it newly gathered or previously available only in obscure academic  sources. There are excellent introductory sections on the main mammal  groups, and good indexes and bibliographies -- in short , everything one  needs to find and enjoy looking at mammals.  But the most unique and useful  feature (as well as the greatest delight -- and why this is a true  classic), are the illustrations - hundreds of beautifully drawn colour  plates painted from life (often in the most demanding of circumstances),  that will allow you to settle important questions like &quot;Is that a  Woolly False Vampire Bat or a Great False Vampire Bat that just bit  you&quot; without flaming your travelling companions. (The book is  especially strong on Bats.) Flying squirrels, monkeys, oppossums, sloths,  deer mice, armadillos dolphins and skunks, they are all here. I would  highly recommend this book both for amateurs and professionals (whether  they are going to central america or not!). Every academic library should  have a copy of it. <p>The care taken over detail throughout make the book  both scientifically valuable and highly readable. It is a true labour of  love -  and just look at this quote from  the author's preface!  &quot;Some species I painted while sitting in a truck, using the steering  wheel as an easel, and some in a tent with a hadlamp at night, but most  were done outside during the day, sitting on the ground or on a log.  The  white background of the plates suffered from a continuous onslaught of  dust, sweat, and grime, and other indefinable debris. Carrying the plates  throughout Central America involved some harrowing experiences, one of  which was a short flight to Tortuguero in Costa Rica. The pilot had at  length persuaded me to put my portfolio in the front baggage hold in the  nose of the plane, and after we took off he realized that the door to this  hold had come open. While the other four passengers agonized over the  possibility of the plane going down if the luggage became tangled in the  propellors, I was trying to follow our coordinates so I could search for my  plates if they fell to the swampy ground below. Fortunately, we landed at a  small airfield, corrected the problem, and lost nothing but peace of  mind.&quot;\"},\n",
       " {'biologicalsciences_2010': \"This book offers guidance on acting in dangerous interpersonal situations, and, far more importantly, how to detect warning signs--minutes to years in advance--and act on them.  For its main tenet is that violent crimes, from date stalking that goes unannounced every day to assassinations that grip the world, rarely occur out of the blue.  Some behaviors that may not seem alarming, from excessive enthusiasm about a business relationship to being the brunt of dark jokes, can be good indicators of a person's trajectory toward violence.  And then there are events like bomb threats, which seem more dangerous than they usually are.  Here we learn how to spot the signs, analyze the situation and act in ways that can reduce or eliminate the danger.  This information could possibly have prevented the Virginia Tech shootings--the foreshadowing of which is only now being acknowledged--along with countless other crimes in homes, businesses and streets.\\t\\tDrawing on many real-life examples, DeBecker uses common sense, astute analogies and a keen understanding of human psychological workings to provide a lucid, practical and deeply empowering book.  Though his tone is serious and unafraid to describe the brutalities humans can afflict on each other, The Gift of Fear is very readable and sometimes even enjoyable.

We are uncomfortable judging someone else\\'s alterior motives.  Our ideals tell us to give everyone a chance.  Our intuition tells us otherwise. De Becker tries to shock the reader with case studies from his practice to be more attentive to intuition and accept some people are evil. While we are ashamed to make accusations about the dark motives of others, refusing to do so disables your best protection system, your intuition.\\t\\tYour intuition has been fine tuned by evolution to accurately intuit the motivation of others - the ability to deceive and detect deception are competitive advantages.  Turns out  there are universal methods of building trust; predators try to short circuit the process with techniques like forced teaming, too many detail, and unsolicited offers for help. The difference between harmless social clumminess and tactics of a predator are small, but are intuition is tuned to tell the difference. It feels forced, a little off.\\t\\tWe also dull our intuition by not separating worry from fear.  De Becker careful distingusihes the two - worry is general, it is not linked to a specific threat.  Fear can be traced to a threat - although it can take a deliberate review to understand what is making your intuition fire.\\t\\tThe more analytical parts of the book aren\\'t included to replace your intuition, but to inform it.  Knowing the patterns can help your split second decision making, as de Becker says, the first step to getting the right answer is asking the right questions.  De Becker provides the JOCA - Justification, Options, Consequences, Ability - framework for aiding intuition in evaluating threats. Any change to the JOCA factors should trigger a reassess of the threat - it seems like this is how my intuition works, de Becker just codified it.\\t\\tAnother way to strengthen your intuition is to start seeing events as a chain - seemingly random events have predictable chains of events.  The best way to reduce danger is to, with the help of intuition, recognize the chain and to end things early. Rather than being confrontational, it is best to end with threats early - often ignoring or a gently letting them down early will avoid later, more threatening, confrontations.\\t\\tThe problems with the Gift of Fear is the uneven quality of the examples - especially the \\\\just so\\\\\" stories about the serendipity of following inution and success.  It also gets repetitive - there are many different threats discussed'},\n",

       " {'biologicalsciences_2010': \"This is the most important book I have ever read - I wish I could give it 10 stars.  I am 32 years old and have had three stalking experiences.  Two were mild...one was severe.  I foolishly thought that, because I had survived those incidences, I was an expert in having it NOT happen again.  As I read Gavin's book, I saw more and more that, not only was I clueless about how to protect myself, I was STILL making the same mistakes that landed me with stalkers to begin with.<p>I was brought up in a world where you respect others and are always kind and courteous.  There *are* benefits to being kind and courteous.  But I was doing it in the wrong situations.  I would be approached by a man that had I had no interest in.  Instead of telling him firmly and forcefully that I was NOT interested, I would smile and let them know that was really flattered and, well, who knows what the future would bring.  In other words, I always tried to let them down easy.  And so they would come back again and again.  This was a pattern that happened over and over in my life.<p>My most serious stalking incident happened over ten years ago.  Yet this person STILL contacts me.  However, in the early years I handled it all wrong.  My boyfriend at the time contacted him telling him to leave me alone.  First I would hang up on him when he called.  Next I had my number changed.  Gavin's book showed me that everything I did to handle the situation could have potentially made the situation worse (it did!).  I was threatened, harassed, made to constantly look over my shoulder.  I can see now that I should have simply ignored the problem - not had anyone contact my stalker, not changed my number but instead have kept the number and just gotten an additional line.  For the past 7 years, I have stopped reading the emails that this sick man sends me (I simply save them to a folder...unread).  I never acknowledge his existence.  That was the *only* right thing I have done in this situation.<p>Now that I have read this book, I feel better prepared to handle situations like have happened in the past.  I will be firm in my `no's!' and unwavering in my speech.  This book has helped me learn the tricks of the trade.  I am *not* a professional counselor.  I am just a person who has had a rough time in the past with people wanting to take advantage of a female's kindness.  Thanks to this book, I am far better prepared to handle situations in the future.<p>I think everyone should read this book.  And everyone should give a copy to their loved ones.  The Gift of Fear is a gift of empowerment!\"},\n",

He came from a family in which violence was a part of daily life, and he heads a company dedicated to protecting people from it.\\t\\tBut this book is not a cliched recital of facts. Nor does it encourage you to go around fearful and clutching at your keys. What I thought was most valuable about this book was de Becker's insistence that we learn to distinguish from ordinary worry, which decreases our ability to be fully present, and fear, which can save our lives. For example, the book opens with a gripping story in which a victim saved her own life by getting up and following her attacker out of her apartment. Later, she said she felt possessed as she traveled down that corridor silently behind him, and exited to safety while he went into her kitchen to look for a knife. She explained that her inner voice had told her to do this, promising her it would get her out of this horrible situation alive.\\t\\tThis is what de Becker means when he talks about the gift of fear. It is that inner voice which can read situations very fast, so fast that there is literally no time to think about it. In our secular rationalistic society, people often feel embarrassed that they take a dislike to someone on sight, that they feel uncomfortable getting into an elevator with that person, that something just didn't feel right. But how silly to pay attention to such vague feelings. Because intuition can be so unreliable. Right?\\t\\tWrong! says de Becker. While it might be true that intuition can be unreliable, it is still valuable to listen carefully to these warnings. We have all had these experiences. I remember one sunny day walking out by myself along a path frequented by joggers and cyclists. On this particular occasion there was no-one in sight, either to the front or back of me. And yet I did not feel like continuing upon that path. So I turned around and walked back. Nothing happened. Was I right, or wrong? I don't know. But at least I didn't suffer through a horrible experience.\\t\\tFor anyone who worries about personal safety, buy this book and read it frequently. It achieves the right balance between being prudent and realistic, and making your life a misery with too much worry. Five stars.\"},\n",

Recommend it to everyone, especially women, to recognize signs of dangerous situations from friend or stranger.  Excellent insight from author who knows about protecting people in high places and real world situations with none of the psycho-babble of so-called experts. Very current with the recent theater and school shootings. Should be required reading with eyes wide open by parents, teachers and those with any qualms about someone in their life. Not written to scare you but to sharpen your awareness. Worth having both the print version and Kindle e-Book with more up-to date info.'},\n",

       " {'biologicalsciences_2010': \"A pretty good book on human nature and how predators approach, evaluate, stalk, and victimize their prey.<p>Women would most benefit from the book since the message in a nutshell is to say no, mean it, and follow through with actual versus percieved disengagement. Lot of women need an excuse to do this and the book provides a good one.<p>The one thing I strongly disagree with in this book is Mr De Beckers irrational fear of handguns as a means of self defense, using old tired straw man arguments he proves only that his childhood induced anxiety derived from his weapon sporting drug addicted parents is still in full force.<p>He proves this by encouraging women to take an IMPACT course, then states that guns are somehow the root of most evils in our country. The difference between learning how to gouge out a mans eyes vs. unleashing hundreds of foot pounds of energy via a handgun is lost on me and was the only irrational thread in an otherwise interesting read.<p>He ends his diatribe against firearms by stating that our anscetors would be horrified to know how many of us carry and are willing to use weapons to defend our selves. Wow, talk about revisionist history, just the opposite is true of course, they would be horrified at how many of us simply allow ourselves to be sheep when the wolves come calling.<p>One of his typical anti-gun storys has to do with a complete moron who kept an unsecured weapon that was inaccessible to everyone but the intruder. The intruder of course locates the weapon and is then confronted by our moron. He is then held with his daughters for over an hour. The intruder finally leaves after deciding to not kill them (how sweet). Moral of the story is of course weapons will be used against us so lets get rid of all the weapons, silly. <p>Two other possibilties exist of course. 1st the intruder is confronted by our moron, neither is armed, confrontation would most definetely have ensued with unknown results but likely the street tuff would have beaten his brains in. 2nd moron actually has his gun and confronts the intruder, intruder is stopped (killed) or arrested and cannot confront and or harm any other familys at least until De Beckers liberal pals let him out a few years later. Now of these three possibilites which would you want to bet your life on? Mr. De Becker picks the sheep scenario for you, but for him and his clients it's armed body guards, otherwords other people defending you is ok, you defending you is just stupid so dont even try.<p>Read the book, but don't buy into his view that the only answer to violence is to recognize and avoid, those are very good tools to have, usually the best if possible, but also be ready to respond when or if you can't avoid violence.<p>I have had personal experience with a handgun that twice stopped crimes. Once a break and enter by a hopped up druggy who got sent packing by a 100lb women, later it turned out he was also an off and on again rapist among other things. One other time personally to stop a beating of an old man by a group of thugs. <p>Of course I am trained, experienced and more than willing to put a lot of lead through anyone that wants to live by the sword, also trained in hand to hand, and edged weapons. I spent moeny and time learning it and having the training and means to protect myself makes me less, not more likely to engage people with vilolence since I understand it and the consequences it can bring.<p>If you are a moron like De Beckers pal who had no training or will to repsond and thought the mere presence of a weapon would prevent violence then like him it would probably just be better to drop your pants, bend over and take whatever the world dishes out.\"},\n",

(I was 12 and 13 yrs old)\\t-I've had countless men demand that I get into their car, I've been followed in stores and down the street by strangers.\\t-I've been grabbed and manhandled in crowded clubs or at concerts and couldn't identify who had done it because my immediate area was so crowded.\\t The terrifying thing about these situations I've just illustrated is that I could walk up to any woman on the street and she could tell me similar stories.  One of the most important things I learned from this book were the specific methods used by attackers to convince a woman to let them into their house, give them a ride, etc.  Now that I know the methods, I recall that many of them have been used on me. This is frightening because I know there are girls and women out there who find it difficult to say no to a man, are too trusting, easily charmed, or quick to rationalize their intuition. I say EVERY woman should read this book! I particularly believe that teenage girls should not only read it, but commit it to memory. It really could save your life, and offers insight into HOW these predators lure and persuade their marks. Once you know the methodology of these creeps, you can spot them blindfolded.\\t  Also equally as important were the other topics covered, such as how to deal with a stalker (also extremely important information for all women-we've all dealt with exes who wouldn't let go, or persistent suitors who won't take no for an answer)\\t  It is unfortunate that women are treated as prey but it is a hard reality. All women should be equipped to deal with potentially violent or threatening circumstances. We are victims only if we fail to educate ourselves. Read this book to garner that education! I think you should, my intuition tells me so.\"},\n",
